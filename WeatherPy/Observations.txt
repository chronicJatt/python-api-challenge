Observations:
1. There are over twice as many cities in this dataset from the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern, which may skew observations as the differences in abundance of land area vs. sea area in either hemispheres may have an effect on local and micro-climates.
2. In looking at Fig 1 (City Latitude vs. Max Temp), Fig 5 (Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude) & Fig 6 (Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude), we can conclude that vicinity to the equator has a noticeable effect on Maximum Temperature.
3. Although most parallels (lines of latitude) sample some cloudiness at 100%, the 20th parallel shows data only at 40% and below. I believe this could be because city sampling for this parellel largely encompasses the Sahel and the area immediately North of it - which is an area of Africa that is well known for it's arid conditions.
